- Build specialized machine or job types

.. code-block:: python

    # Example of defining a custom component
    from jobshoplab.state_machine.core.state_machine import Component

    class CustomComponent(Component):
        def __init__(self, name, properties):
            super().__init__(name)
            self.properties = properties
            
        def process(self, state):
            # Custom processing logic
            return modified_state
